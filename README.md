**Temp Humidity Monitor (Hydroponics / Microgreens)
Hydro Monitor C6: ESP32-C6 + 1.47" TFT + DHT22. Live temp/humidity on-screen + Wi-Fi HTTP (JSON/raw). For hydroponics & microgreens.**

Hydro Monitor C6 — Temperature & Humidity Monitor for Hydroponics / Microgreens (ESP32-C6 + 1.47" TFT)

Want to track your grow-room microclimate without cloud apps, subscriptions, or sketchy IoT platforms? This compact PCB turns an ESP32-C6 + 1.47" TFT and a simple DHT11 sensor into a clean, always-on monitoring station with a built-in Wi-Fi web API.

Instant readout on the TFT screen
Query remotely over HTTP (JSON or raw numeric value)
Free, ready-to-flash firmware
Beginner-friendly assembly (minimal soldering skills needed)
Why you’ll love it (and why your plants will too) “Set & Forget”

Assemble it, flash it, place it in your grow space. Then: quick glance on the display, plus remote reads over Wi-Fi whenever you want.

Local Wi-Fi, no cloud dependency

No account. No cloud. No subscription. Integrate it into Home Assistant, dashboards, Python scripts, NAS automations—whatever you already run.

**Easy to build / Designed for simple assembly with very few parts:**

1× DHT12
1× ESP32-C6 module with 1.47" TFT (172×320)
a handful of straightforward solder joints
Key Features - Display: temperature + humidity on a crisp 1.47" TFT, clean UI, premium look. - Built-in HTTP API: - endpoint returning JSON (temp/humidity) - endpoint returning raw values (perfect for scripts/automation) - Wi-Fi operation: runs on your network (and can also work as an AP depending on firmware/config). - Firmware: free and easy to flash. -

**Perfect for**

Hydroponics / indoor grows / greenhouses - spot dry air before it hurts growth - check day/night swings easily

Microgreens & germination trays - stable humidity = better germination - avoid mold (too humid) or slowdowns (too dry)

Grow racks & multi-zone setups one unit per shelf/zone = real microclimate data, not a room average

**What you get**

1× PCB (bare board) only, ready to assemble (ESP32-C6 + TFT module, DHT22 sensor, headers/connectors: not included. Sourced separately.)

What you need - 1× ESP32-C6 dev board with 1.47" TFT - 1× DHT11 sensor - soldering iron + solder (beginner level is fine) - USB cable to flash firmware

HTTP API examples (simple & practical) - GET /json → {"temp":24.6,"hum":58} - GET /temp → 24.6 - GET /hum → 58

Great for: - Home Assistant (REST sensors) - Node-RED - Python scripts - Custom dashboards

Why this PCB vs. a random off-the-shelf sensor? Readable instantly (screen built in) - Local control (HTTP access) - No cloud, no account - Scalable: deploy multiple units per zone - Simple & reliable: minimal parts, minimal hassle -

**Quick FAQ 
**
Do I need advanced electronics skills? No—if you can solder headers/basic parts, you’re good.

Is firmware included? Yes—free and ready to flash.

Can I integrate it into my monitoring system? Absolutely—that’s the whole point: poll it via HTTP and plug it into your automation stack.

If you want simple, local, always-visible climate monitoring built for hydroponics and microgreens, this PCB is made for you. Place one per grow zone and stop guessing your humidity.
